## Google Drive Synchronization (New!)

![Sync Statistics Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unchase/antigravity-storage-manager/master/screenshots/sync-dashboard.png)

Keep your conversations synchronized across multiple machines using your Google Drive.

### Setup Sync
1. Run command `Antigravity Storage: Setup Google Drive Sync`
2. **Authentication**: Log in with your Google account.
3. **Session Setup**:
    - **New Session**: Create a new device entry (e.g., "Work Laptop").
    - **Resume Session**: Reconnect to an existing device ID from the list to avoid duplicates.
4. **Master Password**: Create or confirm your master password to encrypt your data.
5. **Done!** Conversations will automatically sync in the background.

👉 **[Detailed Setup Guide](https://github.com/unchase/antigravity-storage-manager/blob/master/SYNC_SETUP.md)**: Includes step-by-step instructions for configuring Google Cloud Console, adding test users, and troubleshooting.

### Security
- **Zero Knowledge**: All data is encrypted locally before being uploaded.
- **Master Password**: Only you know the password. It is stored securely in your OS keychain.
- **Limited Access**: The extension only accesses files it created (app-specific folder).

### Manual Sync
- Click the **AG Sync** button in the status bar
- Or run `Antigravity Storage: Sync Now`

### Manage Sync

    - **Connected Devices**: Visualize sessions grouped by machine (e.g., "Home PC").
    - **Status Indicators**: See which sessions are **Online** (Green) or **Offline** (Red) based on recent activity.
    - **Quota Tracking**: Monitor quota usage (Credits/Limits) for each active session.
    - **Manage Conversations**: Rename or Delete conversations directly from the list.
    - **Selective Sync**: Manually **Upload** (Local Only) or **Download** (Remote Only) individual conversations.

      - **Delete (🗑️)**: Remove stale machines and their sessions.
      - **Force Push (🔄)**: Send a sync signal to other devices.
    - **User Info**: Displays the current user's email and plan (from Google AI Studio or Google Drive).
    - **Active Transfers**: Monitor ongoing uploads and downloads in real-time. **Click** on any item to open the conversation instantly.
    - **Force Sync (🚀)**: Manually trigger a forceful synchronization that bypasses local caches and flushes server buffers.
    - **Real-time Data**: Information is automatically refreshed during sync events; you can also use the **Refresh Data (🔄)** button to reload manually.
- **Status Bar**: The **AG Sync** icon updates dynamically (☁️ Cloud, 🔄 Spinning, ⚠️ Error, ✅ Check) to reflect the current state.

## Telegram Bot Integration (New!)

Receive real-time notifications about your quota usage, system statistics, and sync status directly in Telegram. You can also control Antigravity efficiently using interactive commands.

    - `/ping` — Check bot health.
- **Secure Access**: Restrict bot access to specific Telegram User IDs or Usernames. Unauthorized users receive an instant "Access Denied" response with their Chat ID for easy configuration.

### Setup Guide

1. **Create a Telegram Bot**:
    - Open [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in Telegram.
    - Send `/newbot` and follow the instructions to create a bot.
    - Copy the **HTTP API Token** provided by BotFather.

2. **Configure Extension**:
    - Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`).
    - Search for `antigravity telegram`.
    - Set **Bot Token**: Paste your API Token.
    - Set **Allowed User IDs**: (Optional) Array of numeric Telegram User IDs allowed to interact with the bot.
    - Set **Allowed Usernames**: (Easier) Array of Telegram usernames (without `@`) allowed to use the bot (e.g., `["your_username"]`).
    - **Note**: For usernames to work, you must start a chat with the bot first so it can resolve your Chat ID.

3. **Start the Bot**:
    - The bot starts automatically when VS Code launches if the token is configured.
    - Send `/start` or `/help` to your bot to begin.

### Configuration Options
- `antigravity.telegram.botToken`: Your bot's API token.
- `antigravity.telegram.userIds`: List of authorized numeric user IDs.
